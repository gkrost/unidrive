# Markdown consolidation audit

Analysis + plan only. Nothing here is executed; a follow-up runs the approved plan.
Goal: fewer files, fewer lines, more compressed text — without losing load-bearing
information. Every disposition is re-verified against code / merged PRs / issue state,
not against the prose being audited.

Inventory: **59 `.md` files, ~18,990 lines** (`find . -name '*.md' -not -path '*/build/*'`).

Sanctioned doc surface (`AGENTS.md` §"Doc surface is bounded"): `AGENTS.md`, `README.md`,
`BACKLOG.md`, `CLOSED.md`, `BOOSTERS.md`, `docs/adr/`, `docs/audits/`, `docs/dev/specs/`,
`docs/dev/plans/`, per-module READMEs. **Outside the sanction:** `docs/dev/research/`,
`docs/dev/findings/`, `docs/dev/lessons/`, `docs/dev/ops/` — each flagged below.

## Disposition table

Disposition key: KEEP · COMPRESS→~N · MERGE→file · DELETE (superseded) · RELOCATE→dir.
"shipped" = feature is on `origin/main` and cited in `CLOSED.md`; verified against code.

| file | lines | purpose | disposition | evidence |
|---|---:|---|---|---|
| AGENTS.md | 93 | rulebook | KEEP (1 edit §11) | sanction list must add research/findings/lessons/ops decision |

## Contradictions (doc vs code; code is truth)

1. **`bug-hunt-third-review.md` §"Status update" says B2 (`applyDeleteRemote`) is "Still
   live — `SyncEngine.kt:2550` catch is not `isAlreadyGone`-gated."** CODE: the catch is now
   gated — `SyncEngine.kt:2557` `if (!isAlreadyGone(e)) { … }`; tests at `SyncEngineTest.kt:3197`
   (`applyDeleteRemote transient-error gate`). Issue **#102 is CLOSED** (PR #95). **The doc is
   stale; the code/issue is correct.** (Resolved by deleting the doc.)
2. **Same status table says NEW-1 (`_events`) is "Still live — still `emit`, not `tryEmit`."**
   CODE: `HydrationImpl.kt:41` is indeed still `MutableSharedFlow` + `.emit()` (the prescribed
   `tryEmit` fix was NOT applied), yet issue **#101 is CLOSED** via PR #71 — which fixed only the
   *recovery-handle* mount-hang symptom (`HydrationImpl.kt:104` backgrounds recovery `open_write`
   and returns `Ok` immediately) rather than the general head-of-line mechanism. So the doc and the
   code agree on the mechanism, but **issue #101 is closed on a narrower fix than its own title
   describes** — the steady-state slow-subscriber HOL-block path for non-recovery handles is not
   structurally prevented. Worth re-opening or filing a follow-up; flagged, not in scope to fix here.
3. **`bug-hunt-patterns.md` finding A and `third-review` finding A claim `openSets` inner map is a
   plain `HashMap` (race).** CODE: now `ConcurrentHashMap()` at `HydrationImpl.kt:105` (and the
   per-conn maps); issue **#98 CLOSED** (PR #89). Doc stale; resolved by deletion.

## Dead ends

1. **Broken cross-reference:** `docs/dev/lessons/validator-pin-to-sha-not-branch.md:62` links
   `docs/dev/lessons/one-truth-sync-discipline.md` — **file does not exist** (only two files in
   `lessons/`). Fix on relocate/compress: drop the dead bullet or restore the target.
2. **Plans carry agentic-worker checkbox scaffolding** ("REQUIRED SUB-SKILL: use
   superpowers:…", `- [ ]` task lists) for features already shipped — instructions that no longer
   apply. Resolved by deleting the shipped plans.
3. **UD-### / dates in doc bodies** violate AGENTS.md §12 ("No IDs, dates, or version numbers …
   in document content"): `docs/audits/internxt-{notifications,phantom,websocket}-*.md` headers
   (`UD-370`, `UD-376`, `UD-306`, `2026-05-0x`), the research bug-hunt date headers, and the
   findings docs (`off main at 7f71589`, `2026-05-…`). De-ID during the compress passes.

## Aged / superseded fragments (verified)

- **All four `docs/dev/research/bug-hunt-*.md`** — migrated to issues **#88, #97–#119, #121–#173**.
  Fixed-and-closed: #97, #98, #100, #101, #102, #106, #114. The docs add nothing the issues lack
  except the verification narrative, which is itself stale (see Contradictions 1–3).
- **9 of 10 `docs/dev/plans/*.md`** — shipped; CLOSED.md cites the plan path for each
  (daemon §57, mount §75, hydration §50, subscriber-set §92, ipc-transport §90/§91, view-refresh
  §93/§94, setattr fix-seq §12, ignore-list drained). The closing-citation requirement (AGENTS §11,
  "its closing BACKLOG entry cites the spec path") is satisfied by the **spec**, not the plan — so
  the plan is disposable once the spec is kept.
- **`docs/dev/research/journald-log-sink.md`** — PR #120 merged the design; the proposal is realized.
- **`docs/dev/research/sync-mount-architecture-knot.md`** — the "knot" (sync ↔ mount mutual
  clobber + stale view) was resolved by the mode-mutex (#75) and mount-view-refresh (#86/#87/#91).
- **`docs/dev/research/virtual-file-layer-linux-{1,2}.md`** — the Linux FUSE answer shipped; BACKLOG
  VFS entry now reads "the FUSE mount already delivers this." Only the Windows-CloudFiles tier survives.
- **`BACKLOG.md` issue-number annotations** (e.g. "FIXED in #90") drift as issues close — but
  BACKLOG is now a thin index over GitHub Issues, so the issue state is authoritative; no doc fix needed.

## Proposed end-state

Target tree (sanctioned dirs only; `research/findings/lessons/ops` collapsed):

```
AGENTS.md  README.md  BACKLOG.md  CLOSED.md  BOOSTERS.md  CLAUDE.md  SECURITY.md
docs/env-vars.md
docs/adr/         (5 — unchanged)
docs/audits/      (5 internxt + security-posture + 2 tracking-set live-verify   = 8)
docs/dev/specs/   (11 — kept, several compressed)
docs/dev/plans/   (1 — critical-high-fix-sequence only)
core/**/README.md (5 — unchanged, sync-tracking compressed)
.claude/skills/   (2 — out of scope)
```

Estimated totals:
- **Files: 59 → ~37** (delete 9 plans + 4 bug-hunts + merge 1 VFS brief = −14; relocate 4 out of
  unsanctioned dirs into `docs/audits/`, net file count unchanged by relocation; `journ​ald` either
  −1 or compressed).
- **Lines: ~18,990 → ~9,575** (plans −9,881 of 9,980; bug-hunts −1,015; the rest from compress
  passes on specs/audits/CLOSED/research nets roughly −2,500 against ~+1,000 retained).

**AGENTS.md §11 edit required.** The sanction list omits `research/`, `findings/`, `lessons/`,
`ops/`. After this audit those dirs are emptied/relocated into `docs/audits/`. Either (a) add one
clause sanctioning a single catch-all (recommend folding live-verify + lessons + security-posture
under `docs/audits/` and stating audits hold "reverse-engineering, live-verification, and advisory
notes"), or (b) leave §11 as-is if every survivor lands in an already-named dir (the relocations
above do exactly that — so the **minimal** edit is none, provided the follow-up relocates rather
than sanctions new dirs). Pick (b) for least churn; note it in the execution plan.

## Execution plan (ordered, low-risk first)

Safe deletions/merges first; judgment-heavy compressions last.

1. **[HIGH]** Delete the 9 shipped plans (keep `critical-high-fix-sequence.md`). Pure removal;
   each is cited-as-shipped in CLOSED.md + a merged PR. `−9,881` lines. *Confidence: HIGH —
   verified per-plan against CLOSED citations and code symbols on main.*
2. **[HIGH]** Delete `bug-hunt-third-pass-opencode.md` (byte-identical-minus-table duplicate of
   third-review). `−268`. *HIGH.*
3. **[HIGH]** Delete the remaining 3 bug-hunt docs (`data-safety`, `patterns`, `third-review`) —
   all findings are issues #88–#119; do NOT carry the stale status table forward. `−747`. *HIGH.*
4. **[LOW]** Fix the dead cross-ref in `validator-pin-to-sha-not-branch.md:62` (drop the
   `one-truth-sync-discipline.md` bullet) as part of its relocation. *HIGH (mechanical).*
5. **[LOW]** Relocate `findings/*` (×2), `lessons/*` (×2), `ops/security-posture.md` into
   `docs/audits/`; remove the now-empty `research/findings/lessons/ops` dirs where applicable.
   No AGENTS §11 edit needed if all land under sanctioned `docs/audits/`. *HIGH.*
6. **[LOW]** Merge `virtual-file-layer-linux-1.md` into `-2.md`; keep the Windows-CloudFiles
   half, drop the shipped-Linux half. `−~200`. *MEDIUM — needs a read to dedup the two briefs.*
7. **[MEDIUM]** Decide `journald-log-sink.md`: if PR #120's decision is captured anywhere
   load-bearing (ADR or code comment), DELETE; else COMPRESS→~120 (keep the decision). *MEDIUM —
   confirm the decision has a home before deleting.*
8. **[MEDIUM]** Compress the surviving research briefs (`live-sync-prior-art`,
   `sync-mount-architecture-knot`) to why-records. *MEDIUM — judgment on what stays load-bearing.*
9. **[MEDIUM]** Compress the large shipped specs (`unidrive-daemon-design`,
   `sparse-hydration-roadmap-design`, `sync-progress-subscriber-set-design`,
   `hydration-namespace-verbs-design`, `mount-sync-mode-mutex-design`) — keep the contract +
   §Event-flow / invariants, drop the task-plan residue. These are the closing-citation anchors,
   so they MUST survive in some form. *MEDIUM — re-verify each is still cited before trimming.*
10. **[MEDIUM]** De-ID + compress the audits (`internxt-api-vs-spi`, `internxt-boosters-analysis`,
    the 3 feasibility/investigation notes) and `sync-tracking/README.md`. Strip UD-IDs/dates per
    AGENTS §12. *MEDIUM.*
11. **[LOW]** Compress `CLOSED.md` pre-slim bullets to one line each, preserving every spec/plan
    path citation (those are the grep anchors AGENTS §11 depends on). *MEDIUM — append-only rule
    means don't drop entries, only tighten prose.*
12. **[follow-up, not docs]** File or re-open the #101 narrowness flag (Contradiction 2):
    steady-state non-recovery slow-subscriber HOL-block is unfixed though the issue is closed.
    *Flag for the maintainer — out of scope for a docs PR.*
